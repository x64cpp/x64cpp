  <h2>👋 Hey there, I'm Samy!</h2>

  <p>
    Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Samy, a passionate French law student who loves to code in my free time. Currently, I'm exploring the world of Valorant "chairs" for educational purposes and working on various Discord bots and diverse projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fun fact: I might just play a tad too much League of Legends. I've achieved the rank of Master in League of Legends and Radiant in Valorant, showcasing my dedication not only to coding but also to competitive gaming.

    If you have any questions or just want to chat, feel free to reach me on Discord: <code>421.</code> (Don't forget the dot!!!).
